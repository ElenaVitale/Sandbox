# Reflection
Here's some points I want to reflect on for this week's prac

* I would have liked to have done the Github set up in week 0, 
before the start of the trimester, as I felt it took a bit of time
and work to get it working properly. 
* Now that I'm using github, I like it. I understand the purpose of using it, 
but somehow I don't like having my work openly available to everyone. I think 
it's just a personal thing.
* Last week it took me a few goes to understand how best to use the for loop, 
I'd like to see more examples in the programming patterns to get a better
understanding of how they can be used. 

## Other thoughts
* I still find this subject challenging, but the way the content is set out
does help a lot.
